### Hi there, I'm Matthew 👋 ✨

I'm a Senior Software Architect and from New York, NY. 👨‍💻

I’m currently working on camera surveillance platform that stores video footage and ingests them through a machine learning pipeline to perform video analytics, motion detection, and [more](https://streaming-platform.com)!

- ⚡ I roll deep in devops, kubernetes, architecture design & implementation, and application development.
- 💬 Ask me about how to create resilient and scalable architectures 😄
