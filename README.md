### Hi there, I'm Matthew 👋 ✨

I'm a Senior Software Architect and from New York, NY. 👨‍💻

When problems surface, I methodically turn them into opportunities.

My stewardship keeps me intensely rooted from ideation to code with the intensity for focusing on methodologies that maximize outputs and minimizes inputs. By setting into motion, a “mentoring is implied” culture in a self-governing environment influenced by the strict practice of agile principles, a center of gravity begins to form around the requirements.

The anatomy of my approach, the composition of strategic units that delivers consistent results with discipline & maturity is the foundation for attracting exceptionally smart people, that you can remarkably trust. What this will achieve will blow you away!

Today’s proliferation of technology necessitates a paradigm shift in talent acquisition where being multi-disciplined is a pre-requisite, and having a healthy disregard for the status quo is now a stipulation.

Fully embracing my autodidactic nature has facilitated the rapid ability to educate myself to advanced levels beyond the attainability of the traditional outlets in today’s industry. Because of this, I excel naturally in multi-disciplined environments, roles & capacities.

- ⚡ I roll deep in devops, kubernetes, architecture design & implementation, and application development.
- 💬 Ask me about how to create resilient and scalable architectures 😄

I’m currently working on a camera surveillance platform that stores video footage and ingests them through a machine learning pipeline to perform video analytics, motion detection, and [more](https://streaming-platform.com)!

This platform has been designed using fault tolerant microservices backed by kubernetes.
